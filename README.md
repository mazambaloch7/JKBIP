About me:
    I'm an Experienced Android App Developer & UI Designer. I work on Android Apps & Unity Games. I created BIP library to use it in my various projects. Moreover, It'll help you guys to keep track of your Bluetooth & Internet Connection with negligible lines of code. With almost one line of code you can ask Runtime Permissions like Camera, Read Storage, Write Storage, Location. You can also add more Permissions by calling addPermission() method.

BIP is an Android Library with minimum SDK 19 and maximum 29. This library will help you to keep track of your Internet Connection & Bluetooth Connection.

How to use:

Step 1: Add Maven to your root build.gradle

allprojects {
		repositories {
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
}
  
Step 2: Add dependency

dependencies {
	   implementation 'com.github.JalalJanKhan3336:JKBIP:v1.0'
}

It's free & every interested one is allowed to use it.
